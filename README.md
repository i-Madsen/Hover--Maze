# Hover! Maze
A 3D Three.js application inspired by the original Hover! Windows 95 game.

NOTE: Needs a local server (such as the Web Server for Chrome extension) to run properly from source code. A hosted version can be found on my portfolio website: http://isaacmadsen.com/hover_maze.html

### Controls:
- W - Hold to increase velocity
- S - Hold to slow down/reverse
- A/D - Hold to rotate hovercraft

### Goal:
Get to the center of the maze (some particles can be seen floating above the goal in the sky) as fast as possible without hitting walls.
